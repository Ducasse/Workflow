# Workflow
A powerful and extensible workflow management engine, written in Smalltalk

Workflow was conceived 2005 and originally written in [Squeak Smalltalk](http://squeak.org) and was originally called "Aare", as the swiss river.

Some important points:
- This repository contains only the engine and no examples or user interfaces.
- The original engine depended on the OmniBase object database. We have removed this dependency from this version.
- The source has been exported with [Iceberg](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg) and is compatible with [Pharo](http://pharo.org).
